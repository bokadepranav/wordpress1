<p>Soya has become one of the most controversial food items these days. Is it rich in healthy omega 3 or it is loaded with harmful estrogen? Various concerns regarding some soy products have surfaced in the recent years, thus bringing back the love for soya chunks! Soya chunks are to a vegetarian what chicken breast is to a non-vegetarian- a great source of protein! However, that is not the only nutrient soya chunks have to offer. A plus point is that they are ridiculously easy to add to your diet. Want to know more? Keep reading!</p>



<h2>What are the benefits of having soya chunks?</h2>



<p>Soya chunks pack numerous benefits and enable faster muscle building and metabolism. They are great for the health of bone, hair and skin health. According to a 2015 study published in the journal Molecules, it was found that soy chunks can efficiently lower the levels of bad cholesterol in the body and protect the heart from ailments. The study also discovered that soya chunks stop excess fat from accumulating around the organs, thus promoting weight-loss. The chunks are loaded with fibre, thus allowing the food to pass slowly from the system and keeping you full for longer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="770" height="433" src="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SOYA_1200x768.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-839" srcset="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SOYA_1200x768.webp 770w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SOYA_1200x768-600x337.webp 600w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SOYA_1200x768-300x169.webp 300w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SOYA_1200x768-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></figure>



<h2>What should you remember while having soya chunks?</h2>



<p>Having too much soy products can increase estrogen and uric acid levels in your body, thus contributing to numerous health problems such as water retention, acne, weight gain, mood swings, bloating etc. Increase of uric acid may damage your liver and cause joint pain. Therefore, it is recommended to only have 25 to 30 grams of soya chunks in a day. Moderation is key!</p>

<h2>1. Hummus and Carrots</h2>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-2">Traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/hummus-nutrition-facts-calories-and-health-benefits-4111290">hummus</a>&nbsp;is made from chickpeas and sesame oil, so it contains plant protein as well as healthy fat and fiber.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/calories-in-carrots-3495643">Carrots</a>&nbsp;are a good source of vitamin A and potassium, so the pairing makes a balanced and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/best-healthy-snacks-4160485">nutritious snack</a>.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;As far as calories go, one-half cup of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/hummus-nutrition-facts-calories-and-health-benefits-4111290">hummus</a>&nbsp;has about 200-300 calories,<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;while eight baby carrots have only about 30 calories.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-3">Hummus is also good with baked pita chips or pieces of pita bread. Or try other fresh veggies like celery, broccoli, or cauliflower.</p>



<h2>2. A Small Sandwich</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/turkey-sandwich-c06fa033cea0439496cb1c53ee90bcfe-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-832" srcset="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/turkey-sandwich-c06fa033cea0439496cb1c53ee90bcfe-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/turkey-sandwich-c06fa033cea0439496cb1c53ee90bcfe-600x400.webp 600w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/turkey-sandwich-c06fa033cea0439496cb1c53ee90bcfe-300x200.webp 300w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/turkey-sandwich-c06fa033cea0439496cb1c53ee90bcfe-768x513.webp 768w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/turkey-sandwich-c06fa033cea0439496cb1c53ee90bcfe.webp 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-7">A regular lunch-sized sandwich is probably too big for an afternoon snack, so pack a smaller version. Choose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/what-does-whole-grain-mean-562534">whole-grain</a>&nbsp;bread, lots of veggies, and maybe a slice or two of ham or lean turkey breast. A small sandwich like this offers plenty of vitamins and minerals with less than 300 calories.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-8">Another great snack is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/make-a-healthier-peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwich-2507180">“grown-up” peanut butter and jelly sandwich</a>&nbsp;made with whole-grain bread, no-added-sugar nut butter, and low-sugar fruit spread.</p>



<h2>3. Popcorn</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Popcorn-5c6a3ba746e0fb0001560d8b-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-833" srcset="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Popcorn-5c6a3ba746e0fb0001560d8b-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Popcorn-5c6a3ba746e0fb0001560d8b-600x400.webp 600w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Popcorn-5c6a3ba746e0fb0001560d8b-300x200.webp 300w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Popcorn-5c6a3ba746e0fb0001560d8b-768x512.webp 768w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Popcorn-5c6a3ba746e0fb0001560d8b.webp 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-26"><a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/popcorn-nutrition-facts-calories-and-health-benefits-4111296">Popcorn</a>&nbsp;counts as a whole grain and is high in fiber.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;It’s also low in calories as long as you don’t cover it with melted butter. Keep a few bags of microwave popcorn handy for a quick, healthy snack. One regular-sized bag has around 400 calories.<sup>8</sup></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/food/microwave-popcorn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>&nbsp;You can also buy single-serving sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-27">If plain popcorn sounds boring, sprinkle Parmesan cheese or mixed seasoning blends on top.</p>



<h2>4. A Small Salad</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salad_crop-e0bd898f8f3643f6917f0a713b7ed7cb-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-834" srcset="https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salad_crop-e0bd898f8f3643f6917f0a713b7ed7cb-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salad_crop-e0bd898f8f3643f6917f0a713b7ed7cb-600x400.webp 600w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salad_crop-e0bd898f8f3643f6917f0a713b7ed7cb-300x200.webp 300w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salad_crop-e0bd898f8f3643f6917f0a713b7ed7cb-768x513.webp 768w, https://https://bokadepranav.github.io/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salad_crop-e0bd898f8f3643f6917f0a713b7ed7cb.webp 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-49">&nbsp;A cool, crisp salad can help tide you over until dinner time. Pack your favorite mix of salad greens, vegetables, no-sugar-added dried fruits, and nuts into a resealable container. Then pack another with salad dressing or vinaigrette. Don’t add the dressing until you’re ready to eat as this will make your salad soggy. A small garden salad is low in calories and offers plenty of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-50">Keep your eye on the dressing. Some can add up to 200 calories per 2-tablespoon serving. If you are trying to lose weight, bring along a wedge of lemon or try this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/healthy-swaps-for-ranch-salad-dressing-3495631">low-cal ranch</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/greek-lemon-garlic-salad-dressing-2242120">lemon-garlic salad dressing</a>&nbsp;recipe.</p>

<p>Pasta is a convenient and filling meal, but some types of pasta provide empty carbs, meaning that they offer very little nutritional value alongside the calories. As people’s understanding of carbohydrates, gluten, and the glycemic index (GI) grows, they may wonder: is pasta healthy?</p>



<p>Pasta is an enormously popular food. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pastafits.org/pasta-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Pasta Association</a>, the average person in the United States eats 20 pounds (lb) of pasta every year.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/italys-love-of-pasta-goes-off-the-boil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research from 2017</a>&nbsp;noted a decline in pasta’s popularity, which is partly due to health and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/160774.php">nutrition</a>&nbsp;concerns.</p>



<p>In this article, learn about the benefits and drawbacks of pasta, as well as the different types that are available.</p>



<h2><a>Whole-grain vs. white pasta</a></h2>



<p>Traditional enriched pasta only uses specific parts of the wheat kernel, which means that it loses key nutrients during the production process.</p>



<p>Manufacturers often artificially add some of these nutrients, which include iron and B&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878.php">vitamins</a>, to the final product.</p>



<p>Whole-grain pasta uses all of the wheat kernel, which means that the nutrients remain in the pasta, along with fiber and other beneficial components. Whole-grain pasta is also lower in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245588.php">calories</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161547.php">carbohydrates</a>.</p>



<p>Eating whole grains has been linked to a&nbsp;lower risk of obesity Trusted Source&nbsp;and the associated health risks.</p>
